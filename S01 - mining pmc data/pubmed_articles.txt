Title: The role and therapeutic targeting of the CCL2/CCR2 signaling axis in inflammatory and fibrotic diseases
Abstract: CCL2, a pivotal cytokine within the chemokine family, functions by binding to its receptor CCR2. The CCL2/CCR2 signaling pathway plays a crucial role in the development of fibrosis across multiple organ systems by modulating the recruitment and activation of immune cells, which in turn influences the progression of fibrotic diseases in the liver, intestines, pancreas, heart, lungs, kidneys, and other organs. This paper introduces the biological functions of CCL2 and CCR2, highlighting their similarities and differences concerning fibrotic disorders in various organ systems, and reviews recent progress in the diagnosis and treatment of clinical fibrotic diseases linked to the CCL2/CCR2 signaling pathway. Additionally, further in-depth research is needed to explore the clinical significance of the CCL2/CCR2 axis in fibrotic conditions affecting different organs.

Title: Plasticity and Tumor Microenvironment in Pancreatic Cancer: Genetic, Metabolic, and Immune Perspectives
Abstract: Cancer initiation and progression are controlled not only by intrinsic factors, such as genetic mutations and mesenchymal trait acquisition, but also by dynamic spatiotemporal shifts within the tumor microenvironment. These elements induce plasticity, and enhance invasiveness, metastasis, and treatment resistance, while promoting immune evasion through the reprogramming of the immune microenvironment. However, the molecular mechanisms driving this reprogramming remain unclear. In this review, we summarize the recent pivotal findings on pancreatic cancer, which is a highly malignant disease, and overview the roles of plasticity, metabolic reprogramming, and the creation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment in disease progression. We also present our research on two crucial signaling pathways, i.e., the dynamic interplay between mutational load and the tumor microenvironment, and the acquisition of cancer plasticity via inflammatory responses and metabolic reprogramming. A comprehensive understanding of these processes is expected to transform therapeutic strategies and improve the outcomes of pancreatic cancer patients.

Title: Multi-omics-driven discovery of invasive patterns and treatment strategies in CA19-9 positive intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma
Abstract: Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is a malignant tumor with a poor prognosis, predominantly CA19-9 positive. High CA19-9 levels correlate with increased aggressiveness and worse outcomes. This study employs multi-omics analysis to reveal molecular features and identify therapeutic targets of CA19-9 positive ICC, aiming to support individualized treatment. Data from seven clinical cohorts, two whole-exome sequencing cohorts, six RNA sequencing/microarray cohorts, one proteomic cohort, 20 single-cell RNA sequencing samples, and one spatial transcriptome sample were analyzed. Key findings were validated on tissue microarrays from 52 ICC samples. CA19-9 positive ICC exhibited poorer OS (median 24.1 v.s. 51.5 months) and RFS (median 11.7 v.s. 28.2 months) compared to negative group (all P < 0.05). Genomic analysis revealed a higher KRAS mutation frequency in the positive group and a greater prevalence of IDH1/2 mutations in the negative group (all P < 0.05). Transcriptomic analysis indicated upregulated glycolysis pathways in CA19-9 positive ICC. Single-cell analysis identified specific glycolysis-related cell subclusters associated with poor prognosis, including Epi_SLC2A1, CAF_VEGFA, and Mph_SPP1. Higher hypoxia in the CA19-9 positive group led to metabolic reprogramming and promoted these cells’ formation. These cells formed interactive communities promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and angiogenesis. Drug sensitivity analysis identified six potential therapeutic drugs. This study systematically elucidated the clinical, genomic, transcriptomic, and immune features of CA19-9 positive ICC. It reveals glycolysis-associated cellular communities and their cancer-promoting mechanisms, enhancing our understanding of ICC and laying the groundwork for individualized therapeutic strategies.

Title: Effects of the superior mesenteric artery approach 
Abstract: Patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma present early postoperative systemic metastases, despite complete oncological resection. The aim of this study was to assess two pancreatoduodenectomy approaches with regard to intraoperative circulating tumour cells and cluster mobilization and their potential association with the development of distant metastasis. Patients with periampullary tumours who underwent open pancreatoduodenectomy were randomly allocated to either the no-touch approach or the superior mesenteric artery approach. A total of four intraoperative portal vein samples (at the beginning of the intervention, after portal vein disconnection from the tumour, after tumour resection, and before abdominal closure) were collected to measure circulating tumour cells and cluster numbers. Primary outcomes were the intraoperative number of circulating tumour cells and cluster mobilization. Further, their potential impact on 3-year distant metastasis disease-free survival and overall survival was assessed. A total of 101 patients with periampullary tumours were randomized (51 in the superior mesenteric artery group and 50 in the no-touch group) and 63 patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (34 in the superior mesenteric artery group and 29 in the no-touch group) were analysed. Circulating tumour cells and cluster mobilization were similar in both the no-touch group and the superior mesenteric artery group at all time points. There were no significant differences between surgical groups with regard to the median metastasis disease-free survival (12.4 (interquartile range 6.1–not reached) months in the superior mesenteric artery group and 18.1 (interquartile range 12.1–not reached) months in the no-touch group;  Patients undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy using either the no-touch approach or the superior mesenteric artery approach had similar circulating tumour cells and cluster mobilization and similar overall survival and metastasis disease-free survival. A high intraoperative cluster dissemination during pancreatoduodenectomy was a predictive factor for early metastases in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. NCT03340844 (

Title: Relationship of Signaling Pathways between RKIP Expression and the Inhibition of EMT-Inducing Transcription Factors SNAIL1/2, TWIST1/2 and ZEB1/2
Abstract: Cancer is a deadly disease if it is not treated early with various conventional therapies that include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy and immunotherapy. These treatments manage a large percentage of patients with various cancer types. Normally, we do not develop cancer due to an inherent immune mechanism that is able to suppress its development. However, cancer can also develop means to counter the suppression mechanisms to grow and survive. While the suppressive mechanism is normally dominant in most humans, it also fails in many instances, allowing the cancer to grow and resist treatments. Accordingly, if one is able to use agents that can augment the suppressive mechanisms in cancer, it may result in the elimination of the tumor. In this study, we have addressed factors that support tumor growth and suggested approaches to target these factors that can lead to the destruction of the tumor. Untreated primary carcinomas often lead to progression, invasion and metastasis, a process that involves the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Several transcription factors (TFs) mediate the development of EMT, including SNAIL1/SNAIL2, TWIST1/TWIST2 and ZEB1/ZEB2, which are overexpressed in various carcinomas along with the under expression of the metastasis suppressor Raf Kinase Inhibitor Protein (RKIP). Overexpression of RKIP inhibits EMT and the above associated TFs. We, therefore, hypothesized that there are inhibitory cross-talk signaling pathways between RKIP and these TFs. Accordingly, we analyzed the various properties and biomarkers associated with the epithelial and mesenchymal tissues and the various molecular signaling pathways that trigger the EMT phenotype such as the TGF-β, the RTK and the Wnt pathways. We also presented the various functions and the transcriptional, post-transcriptional and epigenetic regulations for the expression of each of the EMT TFs. Likewise, we describe the transcriptional, post-transcriptional and epigenetic regulations of RKIP expression. Various signaling pathways mediated by RKIP, including the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, inhibit the TFs associated with EMT and the stabilization of epithelial E-Cadherin expression. The inverse relationship between RKIP and the TF expressions and the cross-talks were further analyzed by bioinformatic analysis. High mRNA levels of RKIP correlated negatively with those of SNAIL1, SNAIL2, TWIST1, TWIST2, ZEB1, and ZEB2 in several but not all carcinomas. However, in these carcinomas, high levels of RKIP were associated with good prognosis, whereas high levels of the above transcription factors were associated with poor prognosis. Based on the inverse relationship between RKIP and EMT TFs, it is postulated that the expression level of RKIP in various carcinomas is clinically relevant as both a prognostic and diagnostic biomarker. In addition, targeting RKIP induction by agonists, gene therapy and immunotherapy will result not only in the inhibition of EMT and metastases in carcinomas, but also in the inhibition of tumor growth and reversal of resistance to various therapeutic strategies. However, such targeting strategies must be better investigated as a result of tumor heterogeneities and inherent resistance and should be better adapted as personalized medicine.

Title: Focus on Pancreatic Cancer Microenvironment
Abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma remains one of the most lethal solid tumors due to its local aggressiveness and metastatic potential, with a 5-year survival rate of only 13%. A robust connection between pancreatic cancer microenvironment and tumor progression exists, as well as resistance to current anticancer treatments. Pancreatic cancer has a complex tumor microenvironment, characterized by an intricate crosstalk between cancer cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts and immune cells. The complex composition of the tumor microenvironment is also reflected in the diversity of its acellular components, such as the extracellular matrix, cytokines, growth factors and secreted ligands involved in signaling pathways. Desmoplasia, the hallmark of the pancreatic cancer microenvironment, contributes by creating a dense and hypoxic environment that promotes further tumorigenesis, provides innate systemic resistance and suppresses anti-tumor immune invasion. We discuss the complex crosstalk among tumor microenvironment components and explore therapeutic strategies and opportunities in pancreatic cancer research. Better understanding of the tumor microenvironment and its influence on pancreatic cancer progression could lead to potential novel therapeutic options, such as integration of immunotherapy and cytokine-targeted treatments.

Title: Clinical Evaluation of the Pancreatic Cancer Microenvironment: Opportunities and Challenges
Abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) continues to be a significant challenge in cancer management, with predictions indicating it will become the second leading cause of cancer-related death by 2030. The persistent poor outcomes in PDAC are partly attributed to a complex tumor microenvironment (TME) that inhibits anti-tumor immunity, restricts the penetration of therapeutics, and facilitates cancer dissemination. Only a few aspects of the TME are routinely documented in the clinical setting, but this may evolve as new TME-directed therapies are developed. In this review, we cover relevant aspects of modern PDAC management, summarize TME-related biomarkers and clinical trials, and discuss the potential challenges associated with evaluating the TME in a clinical context. Advances in our understanding of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and its tumor microenvironment (TME) have the potential to transform treatment for the hundreds of thousands of patients who are diagnosed each year. Whereas the clinical assessment of cancer cell genetics has grown increasingly sophisticated and personalized, current protocols to evaluate the TME have lagged, despite evidence that the TME can be heterogeneous within and between patients. Here, we outline current protocols for PDAC diagnosis and management, review novel biomarkers, and highlight potential opportunities and challenges when evaluating the PDAC TME as we prepare to translate emerging TME-directed therapies to the clinic.

Title: Molecular Insight into Gastric Cancer Invasion—Current Status and Future Directions
Abstract: Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide. Owing to the absence of specific early symptoms, most patients with GC are often diagnosed at an advanced stage. Invasion is the most important feature of GC metastasis, which causes poor mortality in patients. Recently, genomic research has critically deepened our knowledge of which gene products are dysregulated in invasive and metastatic GC. This study summarizes the advances in our current understanding of the molecular mechanism of GC invasion and metastasis. We also highlight the future directions of the invasion therapeutics of GC in clinical use. Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide. There has been no efficient therapy for stage IV GC patients due to this disease’s heterogeneity and dissemination ability. Despite the rapid advancement of molecular targeted therapies, such as HER2 and immune checkpoint inhibitors, survival of GC patients is still unsatisfactory because the understanding of the mechanism of GC progression is still incomplete. Invasion is the most important feature of GC metastasis, which causes poor mortality in patients. Recently, genomic research has critically deepened our knowledge of which gene products are dysregulated in invasive GC. Furthermore, the study of the interaction of GC cells with the tumor microenvironment has emerged as a principal subject in driving invasion and metastasis. These results are expected to provide a profound knowledge of how biological molecules are implicated in GC development. This review summarizes the advances in our current understanding of the molecular mechanism of GC invasion. We also highlight the future directions of the invasion therapeutics of GC. Compared to conventional therapy using protease or molecular inhibitors alone, multi-therapy targeting invasion plasticity may seem to be an assuring direction for the progression of novel strategies.

Abstract: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR-T) cell therapy has been widely used in hematological malignancies and has achieved remarkable results, but its long-term efficacy in solid tumors is greatly limited by factors such as the tumor microenvironment (TME). In this paper, we discuss the latest research and future views on CAR-T cell cancer immunotherapy, compare the different characteristics of traditional immunotherapy and CAR-T cell therapy, introduce the latest progress in CAR-T cell immunotherapy, and analyze the obstacles that hinder the efficacy of CAR-T cell therapy, including immunosuppressive factors, metabolic energy deficiency, and physical barriers. We then further discuss the latest therapeutic strategies to overcome these barriers, as well as management decisions regarding the possible safety issues of CAR-T cell therapy, to facilitate solutions to the limited use of CAR-T immunotherapy.

Title: NF-κB signaling in neoplastic transition from epithelial to mesenchymal phenotype
Abstract: NF-κB transcription factors are critical regulators of innate and adaptive immunity and major mediators of inflammatory signaling. The NF-κB signaling is dysregulated in a significant number of cancers and drives malignant transformation through maintenance of constitutive pro-survival signaling and downregulation of apoptosis. Overactive NF-κB signaling results in overexpression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and/or growth factors leading to accumulation of proliferative signals together with activation of innate and select adaptive immune cells. This state of chronic inflammation is now thought to be linked to induction of malignant transformation, angiogenesis, metastasis, subversion of adaptive immunity, and therapy resistance. Moreover, accumulating evidence indicates the involvement of NF-κB signaling in induction and maintenance of invasive phenotypes linked to epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis. In this review we summarize reported links of NF-κB signaling to sequential steps of transition from epithelial to mesenchymal phenotypes. Understanding the involvement of NF-κB in EMT regulation may contribute to formulating optimized therapeutic strategies in cancer.

Title: Mechanisms of obesity- and diabetes mellitus-related pancreatic carcinogenesis: a comprehensive and systematic review
Abstract: Research on obesity- and diabetes mellitus (DM)-related carcinogenesis has expanded exponentially since these two diseases were recognized as important risk factors for cancers. The growing interest in this area is prominently actuated by the increasing obesity and DM prevalence, which is partially responsible for the slight but constant increase in pancreatic cancer (PC) occurrence. PC is a highly lethal malignancy characterized by its insidious symptoms, delayed diagnosis, and devastating prognosis. The intricate process of obesity and DM promoting pancreatic carcinogenesis involves their local impact on the pancreas and concurrent whole-body systemic changes that are suitable for cancer initiation. The main mechanisms involved in this process include the excessive accumulation of various nutrients and metabolites promoting carcinogenesis directly while also aggravating mutagenic and carcinogenic metabolic disorders by affecting multiple pathways. Detrimental alterations in gastrointestinal and sex hormone levels and microbiome dysfunction further compromise immunometabolic regulation and contribute to the establishment of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) for carcinogenesis, which can be exacerbated by several crucial pathophysiological processes and TME components, such as autophagy, endoplasmic reticulum stress, oxidative stress, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and exosome secretion. This review provides a comprehensive and critical analysis of the immunometabolic mechanisms of obesity- and DM-related pancreatic carcinogenesis and dissects how metabolic disorders impair anticancer immunity and influence pathophysiological processes to favor cancer initiation.

Title: A combination therapy of bortezomib, CXCR4 inhibitor, and checkpoint inhibitor is effective in cholangiocarcinoma 
Abstract: Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a biliary tree malignancy with a dismal prognosis. Tumor microenvironment (TME), including cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) has been shown to be involved in drug resistance. To model the interactions between cancer cells and the TME, we established CCA complex patient-derived organoids (cPDOs) to include epithelial PDO (ePDOs) and matched CAFs. While ePDOs were sensitive to bortezomib, we found the matched cPDOs were relatively resistant. Mechanistically, this resistance was correlated with over-expression of CXCR4 in the CAF component of cPDOs. In accord with the role of CXCR4 in the resistance to bortezomib, we found that a CXCR4 inhibitor can reverse the resistance to bortezomib

Title: Context-Specific Determinants of the Immunosuppressive Tumor Microenvironment in Pancreatic Cancer
Abstract: Immunotherapies have shown benefits across a range of human cancers, but not pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Recent evidence suggests that the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) constitutes an important roadblock to their efficacy. The landscape of the TME differs substantially across PDAC subtypes, indicating context-specific principles of immunosuppression. In this review, we discuss how PDAC cells, the local TME, and systemic host and environmental factors drive immunosuppression in context. We argue that unraveling the mechanistic drivers of the context-specific modes of immunosuppression will open new possibilities to target PDAC more efficiently by using multimodal (immuno)therapeutic interventions. Immunosuppression is an almost universal hallmark of pancreatic cancer, although this tumor entity is highly heterogeneous across its different subtypes and phenotypes. Here, we provide evidence that the diverse TME of pancreatic cancer is a central executor of various different context-dependent modes of immunosuppression, and discuss key challenges and novel opportunities to uncover, functionalize, and target the central drivers and functional nodes of immunosuppression for therapeutic exploitation.

Abstract: The extent of pancreatoduodenectomy for pancreatic head cancer remains controversial, and more high‐level clinical evidence is needed. This study aimed to evaluate the outcome of extended pancreatoduodenectomy (EPD) with retroperitoneal nerve resection in pancreatic head cancer. This multicenter randomized trial was performed at 6 Chinese high‐volume hospitals that enrolled patients between October 3, 2012, and September 21, 2017. Four hundred patients with stage I or II pancreatic head cancer and without specific pancreatic cancer treatments (preoperative chemotherapy or chemoradiation) within three months were randomly assigned to undergo standard pancreatoduodenectomy (SPD) or EPD, with the latter followed by dissection of additional lymph nodes (LNs), nerves and soft tissues 270° on the right side surrounding the superior mesenteric artery and celiac axis. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS) by intention‐to‐treat (ITT). The secondary endpoints were disease‐free survival (DFS), mortality, morbidity, and postoperative pain intensity. The R1 rate was slightly lower with EPD (8.46%) than with SPD (12.56%). The morbidity and mortality rates were similar between the two groups. The median OS was similar in the EPD and SPD groups by ITT in the whole study cohort (23.0 vs. 20.2 months,  EPD for pancreatic head cancer did not significantly improve OS, but patients with EPD treatment had significantly improved DFS. In the subgroup analysis, improvements in both OS and DFS in the EPD arm were observed in patients with preoperative CA19–9 < 200.0 U/mL. EPD could be used as an effective surgical procedure for patients with pancreatic head cancer, especially those with preoperative CA19–9 < 200.0 U/mL.

Title: Relationship of dose to vascular target volumes and local failure in pancreatic cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiation
Abstract: The objectives of this study were to evaluate whether dose to the vasculature is associated with local control after surgery in patients with borderline resectable (BLR) and resectable pancreatic cancer (PCA) receiving neoadjuvant radiation therapy (RT) and to identify a dose threshold for clinical use. Patients with BLR and resectable PCA treated with neoadjuvant RT were retrospectively reviewed. During this period, the institutional paradigm shifted from standard fractionation to hypofractionation/stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). A vasculature clinical target volume (Vasc CTV) was contoured for each patient and defined as a 5-mm margin around the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) from its origin to the pancreatic head, the celiac artery from its origin to the level of the trifurcation and any involved vein. The Vasc CTV D95 was normalized to a 2-Gy equivalent dose to determine the optimal dose associated with optimal local failure-free survival (LFFS). Forty-seven patients were included in the analysis. A Vasc CTV D95 of 32.7 Gy was the optimal cutoff for LFFS. Patients with Vasc CTV D95 Equivalent dose in 2 Gy per fraction (EQD2) >32.7 Gy had significantly longer LFFS compared to patients with Vasc CTV D95 EQD2 ≤32.7 Gy at 12 months (91% vs. 51%, respectively) and 24 months (86% vs. 12%, respectively). The median disease-free survival (DFS) for patients with EQD2 >32.7 Gy was 30.4 months compared to 14.0 months in patients with EQD2 ≤32.7 Gy (p = 0.01). There was no significant difference in overall survival (OS) between the two groups. During neoadjuvant treatment, dose to the Vasc CTV is associated with durability of local control (LC) after resection and should be intentionally included in the treatment volume with an EQD2 goal of 31–33 Gy.

Title: Translationally controlled tumor protein: the mediator promoting cancer invasion and migration and its potential clinical prospects
Abstract: Translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP) is a highly conserved multifunctional protein localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus of eukaryotic cells. It is secreted through exosomes and its degradation is associated with the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27), and chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). Its structure contains three α‍-helices and eleven β‍-strands, and features a helical hairpin as its hallmark. TCTP shows a remarkable similarity to the methionine-R-sulfoxide reductase B (MsrB) and mammalian suppressor of Sec4 (Mss4/Dss4) protein families, which exerts guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity on small guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) proteins, suggesting that some functions of TCTP may at least depend on its GEF action. Indeed, TCTP exerts GEF activity on Ras homolog enriched in brain (Rheb) to boost the growth and proliferation of

Title: Current Pathology Model of Pancreatic Cancer
Abstract: Pancreatic cancer is a very aggressive and lethal malignant neoplasm with overall 5-year survival rates below 10%. The field of pancreatic cancer research is rapidly evolving. Reports of newly revealed pathomechanisms of the nature of these tumors are published daily. Nevertheless, many aspects of a pathologic evaluation are still uncertain. It is crucial to be able to pull out practical information that impacts the diagnostic process, called a pathologic evaluation. In this review, we comprehensively summarize some of the recent papers from the pathologists’ and clinicians’ points of view. We specifically focus on pathology assessment and reporting, to make them meaningful for clinical and research purposes. Lastly, we highlight novel diagnostic and research approaches, point out some missing pieces in the field, and suggest further study directions. Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the most aggressive and lethal malignant neoplasms, ranking in seventh place in the world in terms of the incidence of death, with overall 5-year survival rates still below 10%. The knowledge about PC pathomechanisms is rapidly expanding. Daily reports reveal new aspects of tumor biology, including its molecular and morphological heterogeneity, explain complicated “cross-talk” that happens between the cancer cells and tumor stroma, or the nature of the PC-associated neural remodeling (PANR). Staying up-to-date is hard and crucial at the same time. In this review, we are focusing on a comprehensive summary of PC aspects that are important in pathologic reporting, impact patients’ outcomes, and bring meaningful information for clinicians. Finally, we show promising new trends in diagnostic technologies that might bring a difference in PC early diagnosis.

Title: Drug Repurposing, an Attractive Strategy in Pancreatic Cancer Treatment: Preclinical and Clinical Updates
Abstract: The purpose of this review is to provide an update on some of the most promising non-oncology drugs that are already approved and that could be useful also in the treatment of pancreatic cancer, one of the deadliest malignancies worldwide. Current chemotherapy options are unsatisfactory in this cancer and there is an urgent need for more effective and less toxic drugs to improve the dismal pancreatic cancer therapy. The use in cancer therapy of drugs approved for other indications (drug repurposing) is an attractive approach that has the potential to overcome several issues associated with de novo drug discovery, such as dose-finding and safety profiles, accelerating their clinical adoption. In this review, we report proposed mechanisms of action and biological targets of drugs that are candidates for repurposing in pancreatic cancer therapy, focusing on targets that appear to be relevant for their anticancer action. Finally, considering that cancer immunotherapy provides remarkable long-term remission in some responsive tumors and that this strategy is mostly ineffective in pancreatic cancer patients, we discuss recent developments regarding the ability of some repurposing drug candidates to activate anti-tumor immune response, which may be particularly relevant for their clinical effectiveness. Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the deadliest malignancies worldwide, since patients rarely display symptoms until an advanced and unresectable stage of the disease. Current chemotherapy options are unsatisfactory and there is an urgent need for more effective and less toxic drugs to improve the dismal PC therapy. Repurposing of non-oncology drugs in PC treatment represents a very promising therapeutic option and different compounds are currently being considered as candidates for repurposing in the treatment of this tumor. In this review, we provide an update on some of the most promising FDA-approved, non-oncology, repurposed drug candidates that show prominent clinical and preclinical data in pancreatic cancer. We also focus on proposed mechanisms of action and known molecular targets that they modulate in PC. Furthermore, we provide an explorative bioinformatic analysis, which suggests that some of the PC repurposed drug candidates have additional, unexplored, oncology-relevant targets. Finally, we discuss recent developments regarding the immunomodulatory role displayed by some of these drugs, which may expand their potential application in synergy with approved anticancer immunomodulatory agents that are mostly ineffective as single agents in PC.

Title: Safety of perioperative hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy with gemcitabine in patients with resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma: a pilot study of the clinical trial EudraCT 2016-004298-41
Abstract: Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) with gemcitabine, after cytoreductive surgery, may reduce the tumor progression of pancreatic cancer through the reduction of the neoplastic volume and the subpopulation of residual pancreatic cancer stem cells, improving the survival of patients with pancreatic cancer and decreasing the recurrence of the disease. A pilot study is performed with the first ten patients in the experimental group. A randomized study (phase II–III clinical trial) that requires a population of 42 patients, with 21 patients in each group. All patients have a diagnosis of ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, which will be surgically resected with curative intention. (I) Group I: after an R0 resection, patients receive individualized adjuvant treatments. (II) Group II: after an R0 resection, HIPEC is performed with gemcitabine (120 mg/m From 2018 to 2019, 31 patients were recruited for our clinical trial. Fifteen patients were excluded because of intraoperative unresectability or a different intraoperative histologic diagnosis. Ten patients were included in the experimental group (resection plus HIPEC gemcitabine). The mean age was 65±7 years, and six patients were female (60%). We confirmed the histologic diagnosis of ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma in all patients prior to HIPEC. Total pancreatectomy was performed in five patients. The surgical median time was 360 min, and the hospital stay was 11 days. Four patients showed complications classified as Clavien-Dindo type II and one showing type I. Six patients were classified as having stage III tumors. To date, no hospital mortality, locoregional recurrence, or differences between the two groups in terms of perioperative complications, biochemical and gasometric values, or Clavien-Dindo complication grades were observed. Our clinical pilot study demonstrated a similar perioperative outcome that allows the trial until main objectives are achieved.

Title: The Role of Stellate Cells in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma: Targeting Perspectives
Abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a gastrointestinal malignancy with a dismal clinical outcome. Accumulating evidence suggests that activated pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs), the major producers of extracellular matrix (ECM), drive the severe stromal/desmoplastic reaction in PDAC. Furthermore, the crosstalk among PSCs, pancreatic cancer cells (PCCs) as well as other stroma cells can establish a growth-supportive tumor microenvironment (TME) of PDAC, thereby enhancing tumor growth, metastasis, and chemoresistance

Title: Role of Chemokines in the Biology of Cholangiocarcinoma
Abstract: Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), a heterogeneous tumor with poor prognosis, can arise at any level in the biliary tree. It may derive from epithelial cells in the biliary tracts and peribiliary glands and possibly from progenitor cells or even hepatocytes. Several risk factors are responsible for CCA onset, however an inflammatory milieu nearby the biliary tree represents the most common condition favoring CCA development. Chemokines play a key role in driving the immunological response upon liver injury and may sustain tumor initiation and development. Chemokine receptor-dependent pathways influence the interplay among various cellular components, resulting in remodeling of the hepatic microenvironment towards a pro-inflammatory, pro-fibrogenic, pro-angiogenic and pre-neoplastic setting. Moreover, once tumor develops, chemokine signaling may influence its progression. Here we review the role of chemokines in the regulation of CCA development and progression, and the modulation of angiogenesis, metastasis and immune control. The potential role of chemokines and their receptors as possible biomarkers and/or therapeutic targets for hepatobiliary cancer is also discussed.

Title: Metastatic disease in head & neck oncology
Abstract: The head and neck district represents one of the most frequent sites of cancer, and the percentage of metastases is very high in both loco-regional and distant areas. Prognosis refers to several factors: a) stage of disease; b) loco-regional relapses; c) distant metastasis. At diagnosis, distant metastases of head and neck cancers are present in about 10% of cases with an additional 20-30% developing metastases during the course of their disease. Diagnosis of distant metastases is associated with unfavorable prognosis, with a median survival of about 10 months. The aim of the present review is to provide an update on distant metastasis in head and neck oncology. Recent achievements in molecular profiling, interaction between neoplastic tissue and the tumor microenvironment, oligometastatic disease concepts, and the role of immunotherapy have all deeply changed the therapeutic approach and disease control. Firstly, we approach topics such as natural history, epidemiology of distant metastases and relevant pathological and radiological aspects. Focus is then placed on the most relevant clinical aspects; particular attention is reserved to tumours with distant metastasis and positive for EBV and HPV, and the oligometastatic concept. A substantial part of the review is dedicated to different therapeutic approaches. We highlight the role of immunotherapy and the potential effects of innovative technologies. Lastly, we present ethical and clinical perspectives related to frailty in oncological patients and emerging difficulties in sustainable socio-economical governance.

Title: The reciprocal regulation between host tissue and immune cells in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: new insights and therapeutic implications
Abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death and is one of the most difficult-to-treat cancers. Surgical resection and adjuvant therapy have limited effects on the overall survival of PDAC patients. PDAC exhibits an immunosuppressive microenvironment, the immune response predicts survival, and activation of immune system has the potential to produce an efficacious PDAC therapy. However, chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell immunotherapy and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), which have produced unprecedented clinical benefits in a variety of different cancers, produce promising results in only some highly selected patients with PDAC. This lack of efficacy may be because existing immunotherapies mainly target the interactions between cancer cells and immune cells. However, PDAC is characterized by an abundant tumor stroma that includes a heterogeneous mixture of immune cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, neurons and some molecular events. Immune cells engage in extensive and dynamic crosstalk with stromal components in the tumor tissue in addition to tumor cells, which subsequently impacts tumor suppression or promotion to a large extent. Therefore, exploration of the interactions between the stroma and immune cells may offer new therapeutic opportunities for PDAC. In this review, we discuss how infiltrating immune cells influence PDAC development and explore the contributions of complex components to the immune landscape of tumor tissue. The roles of stromal constituents in immune modulation are emphasized. We also predict potential therapeutic strategies to target signals in the immune network in the abundant stromal microenvironment of PDAC.

Title: An update on treatment options for pancreatic adenocarcinoma
Abstract: Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal solid organ tumors. Due to the rising incidence, late diagnosis, and limited treatment options, it is expected to be the second leading cause of cancer deaths in high income countries in the next decade. The multidisciplinary treatment of this disease depends on the stage of cancer at diagnosis (resectable, borderline, locally advanced, and metastatic disease), and combines surgery, chemotherapy, chemoradiotherapy, and supportive care. The landscape of multidisciplinary pancreatic cancer treatment is changing rapidly, especially in locally advanced disease, and the number of treatment options in metastatic disease, including personalized medicine, innovative targets, immunotherapy, therapeutic vaccines, adoptive T-cell transfer, or stemness inhibitors, will probably expand in the near future. This review summarizes the current literature and provides an overview of how new therapies or new therapeutic strategies (neoadjuvant therapies, conversion surgery) will guide multidisciplinary disease management, future clinical trials, and, hopefully, will increase overall survival.

Title: Scavenger Receptors: Emerging Roles in Cancer Biology and Immunology
Abstract: Scavenger receptors constitute a large family of evolutionally conserved protein molecules that are structurally and functionally diverse. Although scavenger receptors were originally identified based on their capacity to scavenge modified lipoproteins, these molecules have been shown to recognize and bind to a broad spectrum of ligands, including modified and unmodified host-derived molecules or microbial components. As a major subset of innate pattern recognition receptors, scavenger receptors are mainly expressed on myeloid cells and function in a wide range of biological processes, such as endocytosis, adhesion, lipid transport, antigen presentation, and pathogen clearance. In addition to playing a crucial role in maintenance of host homeostasis, scavenger receptors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of diseases, e.g., atherosclerosis, neurodegeneration, or metabolic disorders. Emerging evidence has begun to reveal these receptor molecules as important regulators of tumor behavior and host immune responses to cancer. This review summarizes our current understanding on the newly identified, distinct functions of scavenger receptors in cancer biology and immunology. The potential of scavenger receptors as diagnostic biomarkers and novel targets for therapeutic interventions to treat malignancies is also highlighted.

Title: Context-Specific Determinants of the Immunosuppressive Tumor Microenvironment in Pancreatic Cancer
Abstract: Immunotherapies have shown benefits across a range of human cancers, but not pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Recent evidence suggests that the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) constitutes an important roadblock to their efficacy. The landscape of the TME differs substantially across PDAC subtypes, indicating context-specific principles of immunosuppression. In this review, we discuss how PDAC cells, the local TME, and systemic host and environmental factors drive immunosuppression in context. We argue that unraveling the mechanistic drivers of the context-specific modes of immunosuppression will open new possibilities to target PDAC more efficiently by using multimodal (immuno)therapeutic interventions. Immunosuppression is an almost universal hallmark of pancreatic cancer, although this tumor entity is highly heterogeneous across its different subtypes and phenotypes. Here, we provide evidence that the diverse TME of pancreatic cancer is a central executor of various different context-dependent modes of immunosuppression, and discuss key challenges and novel opportunities to uncover, functionalize, and target the central drivers and functional nodes of immunosuppression for therapeutic exploitation.

Title: Multi-omics-driven discovery of invasive patterns and treatment strategies in CA19-9 positive intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma
Abstract: Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is a malignant tumor with a poor prognosis, predominantly CA19-9 positive. High CA19-9 levels correlate with increased aggressiveness and worse outcomes. This study employs multi-omics analysis to reveal molecular features and identify therapeutic targets of CA19-9 positive ICC, aiming to support individualized treatment. Data from seven clinical cohorts, two whole-exome sequencing cohorts, six RNA sequencing/microarray cohorts, one proteomic cohort, 20 single-cell RNA sequencing samples, and one spatial transcriptome sample were analyzed. Key findings were validated on tissue microarrays from 52 ICC samples. CA19-9 positive ICC exhibited poorer OS (median 24.1 v.s. 51.5 months) and RFS (median 11.7 v.s. 28.2 months) compared to negative group (all P < 0.05). Genomic analysis revealed a higher KRAS mutation frequency in the positive group and a greater prevalence of IDH1/2 mutations in the negative group (all P < 0.05). Transcriptomic analysis indicated upregulated glycolysis pathways in CA19-9 positive ICC. Single-cell analysis identified specific glycolysis-related cell subclusters associated with poor prognosis, including Epi_SLC2A1, CAF_VEGFA, and Mph_SPP1. Higher hypoxia in the CA19-9 positive group led to metabolic reprogramming and promoted these cells’ formation. These cells formed interactive communities promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and angiogenesis. Drug sensitivity analysis identified six potential therapeutic drugs. This study systematically elucidated the clinical, genomic, transcriptomic, and immune features of CA19-9 positive ICC. It reveals glycolysis-associated cellular communities and their cancer-promoting mechanisms, enhancing our understanding of ICC and laying the groundwork for individualized therapeutic strategies.

Title: Fibroblast inhibition by tocilizumab enabled gemcitabine/nab‐paclitaxel rechallenge for pancreatic cancer
Abstract: Interleukin‐6 (IL‐6)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway inhibition may overcome chemoresistance of metastatic pancreatic cancer (MPC). We sought to determine the safety and recommended dose of tocilizumab (TCZ), an IL‐6 receptor monoclonal antibody, and biological correlates of tumor shrinkage in patients with gemcitabine (GEM)/nanoparticle albumin‐bound paclitaxel (nab‐PTX)‐refractory MPC. This phase 1 study enrolled 10 patients with MPC who had progressed after GEM/nab‐PTX. Patients initially received TCZ 8 mg/kg on Day 1 and nab‐PTX 100 mg/m

Title: Relationship of Signaling Pathways between RKIP Expression and the Inhibition of EMT-Inducing Transcription Factors SNAIL1/2, TWIST1/2 and ZEB1/2
Abstract: Cancer is a deadly disease if it is not treated early with various conventional therapies that include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy and immunotherapy. These treatments manage a large percentage of patients with various cancer types. Normally, we do not develop cancer due to an inherent immune mechanism that is able to suppress its development. However, cancer can also develop means to counter the suppression mechanisms to grow and survive. While the suppressive mechanism is normally dominant in most humans, it also fails in many instances, allowing the cancer to grow and resist treatments. Accordingly, if one is able to use agents that can augment the suppressive mechanisms in cancer, it may result in the elimination of the tumor. In this study, we have addressed factors that support tumor growth and suggested approaches to target these factors that can lead to the destruction of the tumor. Untreated primary carcinomas often lead to progression, invasion and metastasis, a process that involves the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Several transcription factors (TFs) mediate the development of EMT, including SNAIL1/SNAIL2, TWIST1/TWIST2 and ZEB1/ZEB2, which are overexpressed in various carcinomas along with the under expression of the metastasis suppressor Raf Kinase Inhibitor Protein (RKIP). Overexpression of RKIP inhibits EMT and the above associated TFs. We, therefore, hypothesized that there are inhibitory cross-talk signaling pathways between RKIP and these TFs. Accordingly, we analyzed the various properties and biomarkers associated with the epithelial and mesenchymal tissues and the various molecular signaling pathways that trigger the EMT phenotype such as the TGF-β, the RTK and the Wnt pathways. We also presented the various functions and the transcriptional, post-transcriptional and epigenetic regulations for the expression of each of the EMT TFs. Likewise, we describe the transcriptional, post-transcriptional and epigenetic regulations of RKIP expression. Various signaling pathways mediated by RKIP, including the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, inhibit the TFs associated with EMT and the stabilization of epithelial E-Cadherin expression. The inverse relationship between RKIP and the TF expressions and the cross-talks were further analyzed by bioinformatic analysis. High mRNA levels of RKIP correlated negatively with those of SNAIL1, SNAIL2, TWIST1, TWIST2, ZEB1, and ZEB2 in several but not all carcinomas. However, in these carcinomas, high levels of RKIP were associated with good prognosis, whereas high levels of the above transcription factors were associated with poor prognosis. Based on the inverse relationship between RKIP and EMT TFs, it is postulated that the expression level of RKIP in various carcinomas is clinically relevant as both a prognostic and diagnostic biomarker. In addition, targeting RKIP induction by agonists, gene therapy and immunotherapy will result not only in the inhibition of EMT and metastases in carcinomas, but also in the inhibition of tumor growth and reversal of resistance to various therapeutic strategies. However, such targeting strategies must be better investigated as a result of tumor heterogeneities and inherent resistance and should be better adapted as personalized medicine.

Title: Current Pathology Model of Pancreatic Cancer
Abstract: Pancreatic cancer is a very aggressive and lethal malignant neoplasm with overall 5-year survival rates below 10%. The field of pancreatic cancer research is rapidly evolving. Reports of newly revealed pathomechanisms of the nature of these tumors are published daily. Nevertheless, many aspects of a pathologic evaluation are still uncertain. It is crucial to be able to pull out practical information that impacts the diagnostic process, called a pathologic evaluation. In this review, we comprehensively summarize some of the recent papers from the pathologists’ and clinicians’ points of view. We specifically focus on pathology assessment and reporting, to make them meaningful for clinical and research purposes. Lastly, we highlight novel diagnostic and research approaches, point out some missing pieces in the field, and suggest further study directions. Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the most aggressive and lethal malignant neoplasms, ranking in seventh place in the world in terms of the incidence of death, with overall 5-year survival rates still below 10%. The knowledge about PC pathomechanisms is rapidly expanding. Daily reports reveal new aspects of tumor biology, including its molecular and morphological heterogeneity, explain complicated “cross-talk” that happens between the cancer cells and tumor stroma, or the nature of the PC-associated neural remodeling (PANR). Staying up-to-date is hard and crucial at the same time. In this review, we are focusing on a comprehensive summary of PC aspects that are important in pathologic reporting, impact patients’ outcomes, and bring meaningful information for clinicians. Finally, we show promising new trends in diagnostic technologies that might bring a difference in PC early diagnosis.

Title: CAR-T treatment for cancer: prospects and challenges
Abstract: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR-T) cell therapy has been widely used in hematological malignancies and has achieved remarkable results, but its long-term efficacy in solid tumors is greatly limited by factors such as the tumor microenvironment (TME). In this paper, we discuss the latest research and future views on CAR-T cell cancer immunotherapy, compare the different characteristics of traditional immunotherapy and CAR-T cell therapy, introduce the latest progress in CAR-T cell immunotherapy, and analyze the obstacles that hinder the efficacy of CAR-T cell therapy, including immunosuppressive factors, metabolic energy deficiency, and physical barriers. We then further discuss the latest therapeutic strategies to overcome these barriers, as well as management decisions regarding the possible safety issues of CAR-T cell therapy, to facilitate solutions to the limited use of CAR-T immunotherapy.

Title: The Role of Stellate Cells in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma: Targeting Perspectives
Abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a gastrointestinal malignancy with a dismal clinical outcome. Accumulating evidence suggests that activated pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs), the major producers of extracellular matrix (ECM), drive the severe stromal/desmoplastic reaction in PDAC. Furthermore, the crosstalk among PSCs, pancreatic cancer cells (PCCs) as well as other stroma cells can establish a growth-supportive tumor microenvironment (TME) of PDAC, thereby enhancing tumor growth, metastasis, and chemoresistance

Title: Role of Chemokines in the Biology of Cholangiocarcinoma
Abstract: Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), a heterogeneous tumor with poor prognosis, can arise at any level in the biliary tree. It may derive from epithelial cells in the biliary tracts and peribiliary glands and possibly from progenitor cells or even hepatocytes. Several risk factors are responsible for CCA onset, however an inflammatory milieu nearby the biliary tree represents the most common condition favoring CCA development. Chemokines play a key role in driving the immunological response upon liver injury and may sustain tumor initiation and development. Chemokine receptor-dependent pathways influence the interplay among various cellular components, resulting in remodeling of the hepatic microenvironment towards a pro-inflammatory, pro-fibrogenic, pro-angiogenic and pre-neoplastic setting. Moreover, once tumor develops, chemokine signaling may influence its progression. Here we review the role of chemokines in the regulation of CCA development and progression, and the modulation of angiogenesis, metastasis and immune control. The potential role of chemokines and their receptors as possible biomarkers and/or therapeutic targets for hepatobiliary cancer is also discussed.

Title: Drug Repurposing, an Attractive Strategy in Pancreatic Cancer Treatment: Preclinical and Clinical Updates
Abstract: The purpose of this review is to provide an update on some of the most promising non-oncology drugs that are already approved and that could be useful also in the treatment of pancreatic cancer, one of the deadliest malignancies worldwide. Current chemotherapy options are unsatisfactory in this cancer and there is an urgent need for more effective and less toxic drugs to improve the dismal pancreatic cancer therapy. The use in cancer therapy of drugs approved for other indications (drug repurposing) is an attractive approach that has the potential to overcome several issues associated with de novo drug discovery, such as dose-finding and safety profiles, accelerating their clinical adoption. In this review, we report proposed mechanisms of action and biological targets of drugs that are candidates for repurposing in pancreatic cancer therapy, focusing on targets that appear to be relevant for their anticancer action. Finally, considering that cancer immunotherapy provides remarkable long-term remission in some responsive tumors and that this strategy is mostly ineffective in pancreatic cancer patients, we discuss recent developments regarding the ability of some repurposing drug candidates to activate anti-tumor immune response, which may be particularly relevant for their clinical effectiveness. Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the deadliest malignancies worldwide, since patients rarely display symptoms until an advanced and unresectable stage of the disease. Current chemotherapy options are unsatisfactory and there is an urgent need for more effective and less toxic drugs to improve the dismal PC therapy. Repurposing of non-oncology drugs in PC treatment represents a very promising therapeutic option and different compounds are currently being considered as candidates for repurposing in the treatment of this tumor. In this review, we provide an update on some of the most promising FDA-approved, non-oncology, repurposed drug candidates that show prominent clinical and preclinical data in pancreatic cancer. We also focus on proposed mechanisms of action and known molecular targets that they modulate in PC. Furthermore, we provide an explorative bioinformatic analysis, which suggests that some of the PC repurposed drug candidates have additional, unexplored, oncology-relevant targets. Finally, we discuss recent developments regarding the immunomodulatory role displayed by some of these drugs, which may expand their potential application in synergy with approved anticancer immunomodulatory agents that are mostly ineffective as single agents in PC.

Title: Plasticity and Tumor Microenvironment in Pancreatic Cancer: Genetic, Metabolic, and Immune Perspectives
Abstract: Cancer initiation and progression are controlled not only by intrinsic factors, such as genetic mutations and mesenchymal trait acquisition, but also by dynamic spatiotemporal shifts within the tumor microenvironment. These elements induce plasticity, and enhance invasiveness, metastasis, and treatment resistance, while promoting immune evasion through the reprogramming of the immune microenvironment. However, the molecular mechanisms driving this reprogramming remain unclear. In this review, we summarize the recent pivotal findings on pancreatic cancer, which is a highly malignant disease, and overview the roles of plasticity, metabolic reprogramming, and the creation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment in disease progression. We also present our research on two crucial signaling pathways, i.e., the dynamic interplay between mutational load and the tumor microenvironment, and the acquisition of cancer plasticity via inflammatory responses and metabolic reprogramming. A comprehensive understanding of these processes is expected to transform therapeutic strategies and improve the outcomes of pancreatic cancer patients.

Title: Translationally controlled tumor protein: the mediator promoting cancer invasion and migration and its potential clinical prospects
Abstract: Translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP) is a highly conserved multifunctional protein localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus of eukaryotic cells. It is secreted through exosomes and its degradation is associated with the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27), and chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). Its structure contains three α‍-helices and eleven β‍-strands, and features a helical hairpin as its hallmark. TCTP shows a remarkable similarity to the methionine-R-sulfoxide reductase B (MsrB) and mammalian suppressor of Sec4 (Mss4/Dss4) protein families, which exerts guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity on small guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) proteins, suggesting that some functions of TCTP may at least depend on its GEF action. Indeed, TCTP exerts GEF activity on Ras homolog enriched in brain (Rheb) to boost the growth and proliferation of

Title: A combination therapy of bortezomib, CXCR4 inhibitor, and checkpoint inhibitor is effective in cholangiocarcinoma 
Abstract: Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a biliary tree malignancy with a dismal prognosis. Tumor microenvironment (TME), including cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) has been shown to be involved in drug resistance. To model the interactions between cancer cells and the TME, we established CCA complex patient-derived organoids (cPDOs) to include epithelial PDO (ePDOs) and matched CAFs. While ePDOs were sensitive to bortezomib, we found the matched cPDOs were relatively resistant. Mechanistically, this resistance was correlated with over-expression of CXCR4 in the CAF component of cPDOs. In accord with the role of CXCR4 in the resistance to bortezomib, we found that a CXCR4 inhibitor can reverse the resistance to bortezomib

Title: The role and therapeutic targeting of the CCL2/CCR2 signaling axis in inflammatory and fibrotic diseases
Abstract: CCL2, a pivotal cytokine within the chemokine family, functions by binding to its receptor CCR2. The CCL2/CCR2 signaling pathway plays a crucial role in the development of fibrosis across multiple organ systems by modulating the recruitment and activation of immune cells, which in turn influences the progression of fibrotic diseases in the liver, intestines, pancreas, heart, lungs, kidneys, and other organs. This paper introduces the biological functions of CCL2 and CCR2, highlighting their similarities and differences concerning fibrotic disorders in various organ systems, and reviews recent progress in the diagnosis and treatment of clinical fibrotic diseases linked to the CCL2/CCR2 signaling pathway. Additionally, further in-depth research is needed to explore the clinical significance of the CCL2/CCR2 axis in fibrotic conditions affecting different organs.

Title: The reciprocal regulation between host tissue and immune cells in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: new insights and therapeutic implications
Abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death and is one of the most difficult-to-treat cancers. Surgical resection and adjuvant therapy have limited effects on the overall survival of PDAC patients. PDAC exhibits an immunosuppressive microenvironment, the immune response predicts survival, and activation of immune system has the potential to produce an efficacious PDAC therapy. However, chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell immunotherapy and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), which have produced unprecedented clinical benefits in a variety of different cancers, produce promising results in only some highly selected patients with PDAC. This lack of efficacy may be because existing immunotherapies mainly target the interactions between cancer cells and immune cells. However, PDAC is characterized by an abundant tumor stroma that includes a heterogeneous mixture of immune cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, neurons and some molecular events. Immune cells engage in extensive and dynamic crosstalk with stromal components in the tumor tissue in addition to tumor cells, which subsequently impacts tumor suppression or promotion to a large extent. Therefore, exploration of the interactions between the stroma and immune cells may offer new therapeutic opportunities for PDAC. In this review, we discuss how infiltrating immune cells influence PDAC development and explore the contributions of complex components to the immune landscape of tumor tissue. The roles of stromal constituents in immune modulation are emphasized. We also predict potential therapeutic strategies to target signals in the immune network in the abundant stromal microenvironment of PDAC.

Title: Mechanisms of obesity- and diabetes mellitus-related pancreatic carcinogenesis: a comprehensive and systematic review
Abstract: Research on obesity- and diabetes mellitus (DM)-related carcinogenesis has expanded exponentially since these two diseases were recognized as important risk factors for cancers. The growing interest in this area is prominently actuated by the increasing obesity and DM prevalence, which is partially responsible for the slight but constant increase in pancreatic cancer (PC) occurrence. PC is a highly lethal malignancy characterized by its insidious symptoms, delayed diagnosis, and devastating prognosis. The intricate process of obesity and DM promoting pancreatic carcinogenesis involves their local impact on the pancreas and concurrent whole-body systemic changes that are suitable for cancer initiation. The main mechanisms involved in this process include the excessive accumulation of various nutrients and metabolites promoting carcinogenesis directly while also aggravating mutagenic and carcinogenic metabolic disorders by affecting multiple pathways. Detrimental alterations in gastrointestinal and sex hormone levels and microbiome dysfunction further compromise immunometabolic regulation and contribute to the establishment of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) for carcinogenesis, which can be exacerbated by several crucial pathophysiological processes and TME components, such as autophagy, endoplasmic reticulum stress, oxidative stress, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and exosome secretion. This review provides a comprehensive and critical analysis of the immunometabolic mechanisms of obesity- and DM-related pancreatic carcinogenesis and dissects how metabolic disorders impair anticancer immunity and influence pathophysiological processes to favor cancer initiation.

Title: Focus on Pancreatic Cancer Microenvironment
Abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma remains one of the most lethal solid tumors due to its local aggressiveness and metastatic potential, with a 5-year survival rate of only 13%. A robust connection between pancreatic cancer microenvironment and tumor progression exists, as well as resistance to current anticancer treatments. Pancreatic cancer has a complex tumor microenvironment, characterized by an intricate crosstalk between cancer cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts and immune cells. The complex composition of the tumor microenvironment is also reflected in the diversity of its acellular components, such as the extracellular matrix, cytokines, growth factors and secreted ligands involved in signaling pathways. Desmoplasia, the hallmark of the pancreatic cancer microenvironment, contributes by creating a dense and hypoxic environment that promotes further tumorigenesis, provides innate systemic resistance and suppresses anti-tumor immune invasion. We discuss the complex crosstalk among tumor microenvironment components and explore therapeutic strategies and opportunities in pancreatic cancer research. Better understanding of the tumor microenvironment and its influence on pancreatic cancer progression could lead to potential novel therapeutic options, such as integration of immunotherapy and cytokine-targeted treatments.

Title: Metastatic disease in head & neck oncology
Abstract: The head and neck district represents one of the most frequent sites of cancer, and the percentage of metastases is very high in both loco-regional and distant areas. Prognosis refers to several factors: a) stage of disease; b) loco-regional relapses; c) distant metastasis. At diagnosis, distant metastases of head and neck cancers are present in about 10% of cases with an additional 20-30% developing metastases during the course of their disease. Diagnosis of distant metastases is associated with unfavorable prognosis, with a median survival of about 10 months. The aim of the present review is to provide an update on distant metastasis in head and neck oncology. Recent achievements in molecular profiling, interaction between neoplastic tissue and the tumor microenvironment, oligometastatic disease concepts, and the role of immunotherapy have all deeply changed the therapeutic approach and disease control. Firstly, we approach topics such as natural history, epidemiology of distant metastases and relevant pathological and radiological aspects. Focus is then placed on the most relevant clinical aspects; particular attention is reserved to tumours with distant metastasis and positive for EBV and HPV, and the oligometastatic concept. A substantial part of the review is dedicated to different therapeutic approaches. We highlight the role of immunotherapy and the potential effects of innovative technologies. Lastly, we present ethical and clinical perspectives related to frailty in oncological patients and emerging difficulties in sustainable socio-economical governance.
