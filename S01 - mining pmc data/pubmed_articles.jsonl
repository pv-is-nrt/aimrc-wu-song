{"title": "Context-Specific Determinants of the Immunosuppressive Tumor Microenvironment in Pancreatic Cancer", "abstract": "Immunotherapies have shown benefits across a range of human cancers, but not pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Recent evidence suggests that the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) constitutes an important roadblock to their efficacy. The landscape of the TME differs substantially across PDAC subtypes, indicating context-specific principles of immunosuppression. In this review, we discuss how PDAC cells, the local TME, and systemic host and environmental factors drive immunosuppression in context. We argue that unraveling the mechanistic drivers of the context-specific modes of immunosuppression will open new possibilities to target PDAC more efficiently by using multimodal (immuno)therapeutic interventions. Immunosuppression is an almost universal hallmark of pancreatic cancer, although this tumor entity is highly heterogeneous across its different subtypes and phenotypes. Here, we provide evidence that the diverse TME of pancreatic cancer is a central executor of various different context-dependent modes of immunosuppression, and discuss key challenges and novel opportunities to uncover, functionalize, and target the central drivers and functional nodes of immunosuppression for therapeutic exploitation.", "publication_year": "2023", "publication_name": "Cancer Discovery", "authors": ["Falcomatà, Chiara", "Bärthel, Stefanie", "Schneider, Günter", "Rad, Roland", "Schmidt-Supprian, Marc", "Saur, Dieter"], "database": "PMC"}

High CA19-9 levels correlate with increased aggressiveness and worse outcomes. This study employs multi-omics analysis to reveal molecular features and identify therapeutic targets of CA19-9 positive ICC, aiming to support individualized treatment. Data from seven clinical cohorts, two whole-exome sequencing cohorts, six RNA sequencing/microarray cohorts, one proteomic cohort, 20 single-cell RNA sequencing samples, and one spatial transcriptome sample were analyzed. Key findings were validated on tissue microarrays from 52 ICC samples. CA19-9 positive ICC exhibited poorer OS (median 24.1 v.s. 51.5 months) and RFS (median 11.7 v.s. 28.2 months) compared to negative group (all P < 0.05). Genomic analysis revealed a higher KRAS mutation frequency in the positive group and a greater prevalence of IDH1/2 mutations in the negative group (all P < 0.05). Transcriptomic analysis indicated upregulated glycolysis pathways in CA19-9 positive ICC. Single-cell analysis identified specific glycolysis-related cell subclusters associated with poor prognosis, including Epi_SLC2A1, CAF_VEGFA, and Mph_SPP1. Higher hypoxia in the CA19-9 positive group led to metabolic reprogramming and promoted these cells’ formation. These cells formed interactive communities promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and angiogenesis. Drug sensitivity analysis identified six potential therapeutic drugs. This study systematically elucidated the clinical, genomic, transcriptomic, and immune features of CA19-9 positive ICC. It reveals glycolysis-associated cellular communities and their cancer-promoting mechanisms, enhancing our understanding of ICC and laying the groundwork for individualized therapeutic strategies. \n The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12967-024-05854-9.", "publication_year": "2024", "publication_name": "Journal of Translational Medicine", "authors": ["Ma, Delin", "Wei, Pengcheng", "Liu, Hengkang", "Hao, Jialing", "Chen, Zhuomiaoyu", "Chu, Yingming", "Li, Zuyin", "Shi, Wenzai", "Yuan, Zhigao", "Cheng, Qian", "Gao, Jie", "Zhu, Jiye", "Li, Zhao"], "database": "PMC"}

{"title": "Relationship of Signaling Pathways between RKIP Expression and the Inhibition of EMT-Inducing Transcription Factors SNAIL1/2, TWIST1/2 and ZEB1/2", "abstract": "Cancer is a deadly disease if it is not treated early with various conventional therapies that include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy and immunotherapy. These treatments manage a large percentage of patients with various cancer types. Normally, we do not develop cancer due to an inherent immune mechanism that is able to suppress its development. However, cancer can also develop means to counter the suppression mechanisms to grow and survive. While the suppressive mechanism is normally dominant in most humans, it also fails in many instances, allowing the cancer to grow and resist treatments. Accordingly, if one is able to use agents that can augment the suppressive mechanisms in cancer, it may result in the elimination of the tumor. In this study, we have addressed factors that support tumor growth and suggested approaches to target these factors that can lead to the destruction of the tumor. Untreated primary carcinomas often lead to progression, invasion and metastasis, a process that involves the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Several transcription factors (TFs) mediate the development of EMT, including SNAIL1/SNAIL2, TWIST1/TWIST2 and ZEB1/ZEB2, which are overexpressed in various carcinomas along with the under expression of the metastasis suppressor Raf Kinase Inhibitor Protein (RKIP). Overexpression of RKIP inhibits EMT and the above associated TFs. We, therefore, hypothesized that there are inhibitory cross-talk signaling pathways between RKIP and these TFs. Accordingly, we analyzed the various properties and biomarkers associated with the epithelial and mesenchymal tissues and the various molecular signaling pathways that trigger the EMT phenotype such as the TGF-β, the RTK and the Wnt pathways. We also presented the various functions and the transcriptional, post-transcriptional and epigenetic regulations for the expression of each of the EMT TFs. Likewise, we describe the transcriptional, post-transcriptional and epigenetic regulations of RKIP expression. Various signaling pathways mediated by RKIP, including the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, inhibit the TFs associated with EMT and the stabilization of epithelial E-Cadherin expression. The inverse relationship between RKIP and the TF expressions and the cross-talks were further analyzed by bioinformatic analysis. High mRNA levels of RKIP correlated negatively with those of SNAIL1, SNAIL2, TWIST1, TWIST2, ZEB1, and ZEB2 in several but not all carcinomas. However, in these carcinomas, high levels of RKIP were associated with good prognosis, whereas high levels of the above transcription factors were associated with poor prognosis. Based on the inverse relationship between RKIP and EMT TFs, it is postulated that the expression level of RKIP in various carcinomas is clinically relevant as both a prognostic and diagnostic biomarker. In addition, targeting RKIP induction by agonists, gene therapy and immunotherapy will result not only in the inhibition of EMT and metastases in carcinomas, but also in the inhibition of tumor growth and reversal of resistance to various therapeutic strategies. However, such targeting strategies must be better investigated as a result of tumor heterogeneities and inherent resistance and should be better adapted as personalized medicine.

It is crucial to be able to pull out practical information that impacts the diagnostic process, called a pathologic evaluation. In this review, we comprehensively summarize some of the recent papers from the pathologists’ and clinicians’ points of view. We specifically focus on pathology assessment and reporting, to make them meaningful for clinical and research purposes. Lastly, we highlight novel diagnostic and research approaches, point out some missing pieces in the field, and suggest further study directions.

Current chemotherapy options are unsatisfactory in this cancer and there is an urgent need for more effective and less toxic drugs to improve the dismal pancreatic cancer therapy. The use in cancer therapy of drugs approved for other indications (drug repurposing) is an attractive approach that has the potential to overcome several issues associated with de novo drug discovery, such as dose-finding and safety profiles, accelerating their clinical adoption. In this review, we report proposed mechanisms of action and biological targets of drugs that are candidates for repurposing in pancreatic cancer therapy, focusing on targets that appear to be relevant for their anticancer action. Finally, considering that cancer immunotherapy provides remarkable long-term remission in some responsive tumors and that this strategy is mostly ineffective in pancreatic cancer patients, we discuss recent developments regarding the ability of some repurposing drug candidates to activate anti-tumor immune response, which may be particularly relevant for their clinical effectiveness. Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the deadliest malignancies worldwide, since patients rarely display symptoms until an advanced and unresectable stage of the disease.

However, chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell immunotherapy and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), which have produced unprecedented clinical benefits in a variety of different cancers, produce promising results in only some highly selected patients with PDAC.

PC is a highly lethal malignancy characterized by its insidious symptoms, delayed diagnosis, and devastating prognosis. The intricate process of obesity and DM promoting pancreatic carcinogenesis involves their local impact on the pancreas and concurrent whole-body systemic changes that are suitable for cancer initiation. The main mechanisms involved in this process include the excessive accumulation of various nutrients and metabolites promoting carcinogenesis directly while also aggravating mutagenic and carcinogenic metabolic disorders by affecting multiple pathways. Detrimental alterations in gastrointestinal and sex hormone levels and microbiome dysfunction further compromise immunometabolic regulation and contribute to the establishment of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) for carcinogenesis, which can be exacerbated by several crucial pathophysiological processes and TME components, such as autophagy, endoplasmic reticulum stress, oxidative stress, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and exosome secretion.
