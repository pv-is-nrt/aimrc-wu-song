These elements induce plasticity, and enhance invasiveness, metastasis, and treatment resistance, while promoting immune evasion through the reprogramming of the immune microenvironment. However, the molecular mechanisms driving this reprogramming remain unclear. In this review, we summarize the recent pivotal findings on pancreatic cancer, which is a highly malignant disease, and overview the roles of plasticity, metabolic reprogramming, and the creation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment in disease progression. We also present our research on two crucial signaling pathways, i.e., the dynamic interplay between mutational load and the tumor microenvironment, and the acquisition of cancer plasticity via inflammatory responses and metabolic reprogramming. A comprehensive understanding of these processes is expected to transform therapeutic strategies and improve the outcomes of pancreatic cancer patients.", "publication_year": "2024", "publication_name": "Cancers", "authors": ["Hashimoto, Ari", "Hashimoto, Shigeru"], "database": "PMC"}

Data from seven clinical cohorts, two whole-exome sequencing cohorts, six RNA sequencing/microarray cohorts, one proteomic cohort, 20 single-cell RNA sequencing samples, and one spatial transcriptome sample were analyzed. Key findings were validated on tissue microarrays from 52 ICC samples. CA19-9 positive ICC exhibited poorer OS (median 24.1 v.s. 51.5 months) and RFS (median 11.7 v.s. 28.2 months) compared to negative group (all P < 0.05). Genomic analysis revealed a higher KRAS mutation frequency in the positive group and a greater prevalence of IDH1/2 mutations in the negative group (all P < 0.05). Transcriptomic analysis indicated upregulated glycolysis pathways in CA19-9 positive ICC. Single-cell analysis identified specific glycolysis-related cell subclusters associated with poor prognosis, including Epi_SLC2A1, CAF_VEGFA, and Mph_SPP1. Higher hypoxia in the CA19-9 positive group led to metabolic reprogramming and promoted these cells’ formation. These cells formed interactive communities promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and angiogenesis. Drug sensitivity analysis identified six potential therapeutic drugs.

{"title": "Relationship of Signaling Pathways between RKIP Expression and the Inhibition of EMT-Inducing Transcription Factors SNAIL1/2, TWIST1/2 and ZEB1/2", "abstract": "Cancer is a deadly disease if it is not treated early with various conventional therapies that include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy and immunotherapy. These treatments manage a large percentage of patients with various cancer types. Normally, we do not develop cancer due to an inherent immune mechanism that is able to suppress its development. However, cancer can also develop means to counter the suppression mechanisms to grow and survive. While the suppressive mechanism is normally dominant in most humans, it also fails in many instances, allowing the cancer to grow and resist treatments. Accordingly, if one is able to use agents that can augment the suppressive mechanisms in cancer, it may result in the elimination of the tumor. In this study, we have addressed factors that support tumor growth and suggested approaches to target these factors that can lead to the destruction of the tumor. Untreated primary carcinomas often lead to progression, invasion and metastasis, a process that involves the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Several transcription factors (TFs) mediate the development of EMT, including SNAIL1/SNAIL2, TWIST1/TWIST2 and ZEB1/ZEB2, which are overexpressed in various carcinomas along with the under expression of the metastasis suppressor Raf Kinase Inhibitor Protein (RKIP). Overexpression of RKIP inhibits EMT and the above associated TFs. We, therefore, hypothesized that there are inhibitory cross-talk signaling pathways between RKIP and these TFs. Accordingly, we analyzed the various properties and biomarkers associated with the epithelial and mesenchymal tissues and the various molecular signaling pathways that trigger the EMT phenotype such as the TGF-β, the RTK and the Wnt pathways. We also presented the various functions and the transcriptional, post-transcriptional and epigenetic regulations for the expression of each of the EMT TFs. Likewise, we describe the transcriptional, post-transcriptional and epigenetic regulations of RKIP expression. Various signaling pathways mediated by RKIP, including the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, inhibit the TFs associated with EMT and the stabilization of epithelial E-Cadherin expression. The inverse relationship between RKIP and the TF expressions and the cross-talks were further analyzed by bioinformatic analysis. High mRNA levels of RKIP correlated negatively with those of SNAIL1, SNAIL2, TWIST1, TWIST2, ZEB1, and ZEB2 in several but not all carcinomas. However, in these carcinomas, high levels of RKIP were associated with good prognosis, whereas high levels of the above transcription factors were associated with poor prognosis. Based on the inverse relationship between RKIP and EMT TFs, it is postulated that the expression level of RKIP in various carcinomas is clinically relevant as both a prognostic and diagnostic biomarker. In addition, targeting RKIP induction by agonists, gene therapy and immunotherapy will result not only in the inhibition of EMT and metastases in carcinomas, but also in the inhibition of tumor growth and reversal of resistance to various therapeutic strategies. However, such targeting strategies must be better investigated as a result of tumor heterogeneities and inherent resistance and should be better adapted as personalized medicine.

PC is a highly lethal malignancy characterized by its insidious symptoms, delayed diagnosis, and devastating prognosis. The intricate process of obesity and DM promoting pancreatic carcinogenesis involves their local impact on the pancreas and concurrent whole-body systemic changes that are suitable for cancer initiation. The main mechanisms involved in this process include the excessive accumulation of various nutrients and metabolites promoting carcinogenesis directly while also aggravating mutagenic and carcinogenic metabolic disorders by affecting multiple pathways. Detrimental alterations in gastrointestinal and sex hormone levels and microbiome dysfunction further compromise immunometabolic regulation and contribute to the establishment of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) for carcinogenesis, which can be exacerbated by several crucial pathophysiological processes and TME components, such as autophagy, endoplasmic reticulum stress, oxidative stress, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and exosome secretion.

{"title": "Drug Repurposing, an Attractive Strategy in Pancreatic Cancer Treatment: Preclinical and Clinical Updates", "abstract": "The purpose of this review is to provide an update on some of the most promising non-oncology drugs that are already approved and that could be useful also in the treatment of pancreatic cancer, one of the deadliest malignancies worldwide. Current chemotherapy options are unsatisfactory in this cancer and there is an urgent need for more effective and less toxic drugs to improve the dismal pancreatic cancer therapy. The use in cancer therapy of drugs approved for other indications (drug repurposing) is an attractive approach that has the potential to overcome several issues associated with de novo drug discovery, such as dose-finding and safety profiles, accelerating their clinical adoption. In this review, we report proposed mechanisms of action and biological targets of drugs that are candidates for repurposing in pancreatic cancer therapy, focusing on targets that appear to be relevant for their anticancer action. Finally, considering that cancer immunotherapy provides remarkable long-term remission in some responsive tumors and that this strategy is mostly ineffective in pancreatic cancer patients, we discuss recent developments regarding the ability of some repurposing drug candidates to activate anti-tumor immune response, which may be particularly relevant for their clinical effectiveness. Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the deadliest malignancies worldwide, since patients rarely display symptoms until an advanced and unresectable stage of the disease. Current chemotherapy options are unsatisfactory and there is an urgent need for more effective and less toxic drugs to improve the dismal PC therapy. Repurposing of non-oncology drugs in PC treatment represents a very promising therapeutic option and different compounds are currently being considered as candidates for repurposing in the treatment of this tumor. In this review, we provide an update on some of the most promising FDA-approved, non-oncology, repurposed drug candidates that show prominent clinical and preclinical data in pancreatic cancer. We also focus on proposed mechanisms of action and known molecular targets that they modulate in PC. Furthermore, we provide an explorative bioinformatic analysis, which suggests that some of the PC repurposed drug candidates have additional, unexplored, oncology-relevant targets. Finally, we discuss recent developments regarding the immunomodulatory role displayed by some of these drugs, which may expand their potential application in synergy with approved anticancer immunomodulatory agents that are mostly ineffective as single agents in PC.", "publication_year": "2021", "publication_name": "Cancers", "authors": ["De Lellis, Laura", "Veschi, Serena", "Tinari, Nicola", "Mokini, Zhirajr", "Carradori, Simone", "Brocco, Davide", "Florio, Rosalba", "Grassadonia, Antonino", "Cama, Alessandro"], "database": "PMC"}

A pilot study is performed with the first ten patients in the experimental group. A randomized study (phase II–III clinical trial) that requires a population of 42 patients, with 21 patients in each group. All patients have a diagnosis of ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, which will be surgically resected with curative intention.

(II) Group II: after an R0 resection, HIPEC is performed with gemcitabine (120 mg/m From 2018 to 2019, 31 patients were recruited for our clinical trial. Fifteen patients were excluded because of intraoperative unresectability or a different intraoperative histologic diagnosis. Ten patients were included in the experimental group (resection plus HIPEC gemcitabine). The mean age was 65±7 years, and six patients were female (60%). We confirmed the histologic diagnosis of ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma in all patients prior to HIPEC. Total pancreatectomy was performed in five patients. The surgical median time was 360 min, and the hospital stay was 11 days. Four patients showed complications classified as Clavien-Dindo type II and one showing type I. Six patients were classified as having stage III tumors. To date, no hospital mortality, locoregional recurrence, or differences between the two groups in terms of perioperative complications, biochemical and gasometric values, or Clavien-Dindo complication grades were observed.

It may derive from epithelial cells in the biliary tracts and peribiliary glands and possibly from progenitor cells or even hepatocytes. Several risk factors are responsible for CCA onset, however an inflammatory milieu nearby the biliary tree represents the most common condition favoring CCA development. Chemokines play a key role in driving the immunological response upon liver injury and may sustain tumor initiation and development. Chemokine receptor-dependent pathways influence the interplay among various cellular components, resulting in remodeling of the hepatic microenvironment towards a pro-inflammatory, pro-fibrogenic, pro-angiogenic and pre-neoplastic setting. Moreover, once tumor develops, chemokine signaling may influence its progression. Here we review the role of chemokines in the regulation of CCA development and progression, and the modulation of angiogenesis, metastasis and immune control. The potential role of chemokines and their receptors as possible biomarkers and/or therapeutic targets for hepatobiliary cancer is also discussed.", "publication_year": "2020", "publication_name": "Cancers", "authors": ["Caligiuri, Alessandra", "Pastore, Mirella", "Lori, Giulia", "Raggi, Chiara", "Di Maira, Giovanni", "Marra, Fabio", "Gentilini, Alessandra"], "database": "PMC"}
{"title": "Metastatic disease in head & neck oncology", "abstract": "The head and neck district represents one of the most frequent sites of cancer, and the percentage of metastases is very high in both loco-regional and distant areas. Prognosis refers to several factors: a) stage of disease; b) loco-regional relapses; c) distant metastasis. At diagnosis, distant metastases of head and neck cancers are present in about 10% of cases with an additional 20-30% developing metastases during the course of their disease. Diagnosis of distant metastases is associated with unfavorable prognosis, with a median survival of about 10 months. The aim of the present review is to provide an update on distant metastasis in head and neck oncology. Recent achievements in molecular profiling, interaction between neoplastic tissue and the tumor microenvironment, oligometastatic disease concepts, and the role of immunotherapy have all deeply changed the therapeutic approach and disease control. Firstly, we approach topics such as natural history, epidemiology of distant metastases and relevant pathological and radiological aspects. Focus is then placed on the most relevant clinical aspects; particular attention is reserved to tumours with distant metastasis and positive for EBV and HPV, and the oligometastatic concept. A substantial part of the review is dedicated to different therapeutic approaches. We highlight the role of immunotherapy and the potential effects of innovative technologies.

{"title": "The reciprocal regulation between host tissue and immune cells in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: new insights and therapeutic implications", "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death and is one of the most difficult-to-treat cancers. Surgical resection and adjuvant therapy have limited effects on the overall survival of PDAC patients. PDAC exhibits an immunosuppressive microenvironment, the immune response predicts survival, and activation of immune system has the potential to produce an efficacious PDAC therapy. However, chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell immunotherapy and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), which have produced unprecedented clinical benefits in a variety of different cancers, produce promising results in only some highly selected patients with PDAC. This lack of efficacy may be because existing immunotherapies mainly target the interactions between cancer cells and immune cells. However, PDAC is characterized by an abundant tumor stroma that includes a heterogeneous mixture of immune cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, neurons and some molecular events. Immune cells engage in extensive and dynamic crosstalk with stromal components in the tumor tissue in addition to tumor cells, which subsequently impacts tumor suppression or promotion to a large extent. Therefore, exploration of the interactions between the stroma and immune cells may offer new therapeutic opportunities for PDAC. In this review, we discuss how infiltrating immune cells influence PDAC development and explore the contributions of complex components to the immune landscape of tumor tissue. The roles of stromal constituents in immune modulation are emphasized. We also predict potential therapeutic strategies to target signals in the immune network in the abundant stromal microenvironment of PDAC.", "publication_year": "2019", "publication_name": "Molecular Cancer", "authors": ["Liu, Xiaomeng", "Xu, Jin", "Zhang, Bo", "Liu, Jiang", "Liang, Chen", "Meng, Qingcai", "Hua, Jie", "Yu, Xianjun", "Shi, Si"], "database": "PMC"}

Due to the rising incidence, late diagnosis, and limited treatment options, it is expected to be the second leading cause of cancer deaths in high income countries in the next decade.

{"title": "Scavenger Receptors: Emerging Roles in Cancer Biology and Immunology", "abstract": "Scavenger receptors constitute a large family of evolutionally conserved protein molecules that are structurally and functionally diverse. Although scavenger receptors were originally identified based on their capacity to scavenge modified lipoproteins, these molecules have been shown to recognize and bind to a broad spectrum of ligands, including modified and unmodified host-derived molecules or microbial components. As a major subset of innate pattern recognition receptors, scavenger receptors are mainly expressed on myeloid cells and function in a wide range of biological processes, such as endocytosis, adhesion, lipid transport, antigen presentation, and pathogen clearance. In addition to playing a crucial role in maintenance of host homeostasis, scavenger receptors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of diseases, e.g., atherosclerosis, neurodegeneration, or metabolic disorders. Emerging evidence has begun to reveal these receptor molecules as important regulators of tumor behavior and host immune responses to cancer. This review summarizes our current understanding on the newly identified, distinct functions of scavenger receptors in cancer biology and immunology. The potential of scavenger receptors as diagnostic biomarkers and novel targets for therapeutic interventions to treat malignancies is also highlighted.", "publication_year": "2015", "publication_name": "Advances in cancer research", "authors": ["Yu, Xiaofei", "Guo, Chunqing", "Fisher, Paul B.", "Subjeck, John R.", "Wang, Xiang-Yang"], "database": "PMC"}
